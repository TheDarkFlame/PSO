# PSO
a particle swarm optimisation implementation
This is a particle swarm optimisation implementation.

note that this was designed to be highly modular.
I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where things are going weird, but it looks like particles don't seem to be swarming into a neighbourhood, and instead swarm around randomly.
